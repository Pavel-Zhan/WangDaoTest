genesis 1

1 	in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth  
2	and the earth was without form  and void  and darkness  was  upon the face of the deep  and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters  
3 	and god said  let there be light  and there was light  
4	and god saw the light  that  it was  good  and god divided the light from the darkness  
5	and god called the light day  and the darkness he called night  and the evening and the morning were the first day  
6 	and god said  let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters  and let it divide the waters from the waters  
7	and god made the firmament  and divided the waters which  were  under the firmament from the waters which  were  above the firmament  and it was so  
8	and god called the firmament heaven  and the evening and the morning were the second day  
9 	and god said  let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place  and let the dry  land  appear  and it was so  
10	and god called the dry  land  earth  and the gathering together of the waters called he seas  and god saw that  it was  good  
11	and god said  let the earth bring forth grass  the herb yielding seed   and  the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind  whose seed  is  in itself  upon the earth  and it was so  
12	and the earth brought forth grass   and  herb yielding seed after his kind  and the tree yielding fruit  whose seed  was  in itself  after his kind  and god saw that  it was  good  
13	and the evening and the morning were the third day  
14 	and god said  let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night  and let them be for signs  and for seasons  and for days  and years  
15	and let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth  and it was so
